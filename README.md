# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting customer churn for a telecom company. Using historical customer data, the model helps identify customers who are at risk of leaving the company, enabling proactive retention strategies. The dataset includes both demographic information and service-related features.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop using a company's services, is a significant problem for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, the company can implement targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention.

## Dataset Features
The dataset contains various columns that provide insights into customer demographics, account information, and services used:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
PhoneService: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple phone lines (Yes/No).
InternetService: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, or No).
OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No).
OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has an online backup service (Yes/No).
DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No).
TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No).
StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV service (Yes/No).
StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movie service (Yes/No).
Contract: The type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer uses paperless billing (Yes/No).
PaymentMethod: The payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card).
MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
TotalCharges: The total amount charged over the customer's tenure.
Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
Approach
The project follows the steps below to build an effective churn prediction model:

## Data Cleaning
Handling missing values, correcting data types (especially for TotalCharges), and preprocessing categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between customer attributes and churn rates to gain insights into key drivers of customer churn.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features such as tenure groups and interaction terms to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Modeling: Using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict customer churn. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to improve model performance.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the model's effectiveness in identifying customers likely to churn.
Key Insights
Contract Type and Tenure play significant roles in predicting churn. Customers with month-to-month contracts and shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
Customers with no additional services like OnlineSecurity and TechSupport show higher churn rates, indicating these services may provide some stickiness.
SeniorCitizens and customers with PaperlessBilling show distinct churn behaviors, providing possible areas for retention efforts.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. By identifying at-risk customers, telecom companies can take proactive measures to improve retention and optimize their customer management strategies.
